  <h2>My Story</h2>

<p>I studied business administration for a year ago. After graduation, I started my career as a bank employee, which was a great experience to achieve time management, teamwork and be able to communicate with different people.
<br>It was always my goal to live abroad and immigrating to Germany, learning new languages, working with diverse groups of people and adapting to new cultures help me to gain insight into the problems from different perspectives.
<br>I took a detour from business to something completely different: working in sales. The most valuable things about this experience was listening to the customers, recognizing their needs and providing them with the desired products which are the principles I utilize when I want to design a digital product ( always with the user in mind).
<br>When the corona pandemic hit, I couldn’t work anymore. I was stuck at home trying to figure out what to do next.
I always had a passion for photography,graphic design and industrial design. Therefore I decided to pursue a whole new career. After some research on the
internet, I found the field UI design and this was the beginning of my new career.
In my free time, I love traveling and discovering the world. When I’m not traveling, I’m obsessed with watching new TV-series and also I’m a hobby photographer. <br> Now, I am looking forward to designing brands that make a positive impact on people's lives and make digital products easier and more intuitive to use. </p>
